### Hello world ðŸ‘‹

I am a Brazilian population ecologist interested in many things, but particularly keen to explore the demographic drivers and fates of wildlife populations and how we can translate theory in better management actions for sustainable resources. Iâ€™m also an enthusiast of old school naturalists, citizen science and programming.

Up to that, Iâ€™m a coffee seeker (a.k.a coffee addiction :coffee:), beer taster, and an MPB (Brazilian Popular Music) lover. 

There is nothing too fancy here but I hope there is something of your intrest. Let's build something together, send me your thoughts about the project you liked most and I'll problably be in touch soon.

Cheers! ðŸŒ±
